# LIGO-B2
Contains files for simulation of B2 dynamics

config.m contains all parameters - currently just placeholders <br/>
Please run config.m before running simulation.slx to load and setup parameters <br/>
**Note: config.m will clear workspace, please save work** <br/>

y is the available satates for feedback and the controller as presented in the paper

H.m, C.m, G.m are functions that are not required by SIMULINK, can be used for experimentation in MATLAB
